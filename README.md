# 🖧 Small Office Network Project

Welcome to the **Small Office Network Project**, created using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
This project simulates a real-world small office environment with multiple departments connected through routing and switching.

---

## 📌 Network Overview

This network consists of **four separate departments**:

- 🗄️ **Server Room**
- 👔 **Chairman Room**
- 🛠️ **IT Department**
- 💻 **Computer Department**

Each network is configured to communicate with others using **static routing**.
